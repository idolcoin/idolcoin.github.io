Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see **coding.txt**) or are controversial.\r\n\r\nThe master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new official, stable release versions of Idol Coin.\r\n  \r\nFeature branches are created when there are major new features being worked on by several people.\r\n  \r\nFrom time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically merge-able; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.\r\n  \r\nIssues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after 15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be labeled 'stale'.\r\n  \r\n### Donations\r\n  \r\nDonations to this project are going directly to majika, the original author of this project:\r\n\r\n**LTC Donations:** LhCcwg1JGr7avMBJQbWdhgNPN4ekofswtD  \r\n**BTC Donations:** 1ButbwgFtbkW73ThSWCHXQztYz1JqRpWhn  \r\n**Doge Donations:** DH1eLH1xx9tDormzW2cBwWsEJvXqWu6GoM  \r\n**Cryptsy Trade Key:** da43c4b04fa480acf81c7a3f65e9a901cb69d161   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2014, majika (@majika) founded IdolCoin.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Community\r\nCheck out http://cryptos.us/forums/ for more info about the development.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?   \r\nCheck out the documentation at http://idol.cryptos.us or contact dev@cryptos.us and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
